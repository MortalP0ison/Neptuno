# Neptuno
NeptunoScan is a tool for Automated Information Extraction developed in Java. This tool will help you a lot when
you are in audits and through social engineering, you can insert a usb memory. 
It is not detected by antivirus currently, because it does not make an attack as such, but an extraction of information.
